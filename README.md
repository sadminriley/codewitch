## What is CodeWitch?

CodeWitch is a product that creates infrastructure from Docker, Docker Compose, and Git sources. CodeWitch can run a variety of different types of
coding languages, and is compatible with AWS/GCP/Azure.


I can do many other things like create infrastructure based on resource/code crawling, collect metrics, and report data.
